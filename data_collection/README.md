## data collection
three types of data were intended to be used (not counting btc prices):
- google trend
- reddit submissions/comments sentiment
- twitter sentiment

however, due to the limitations of the official reddit api and the unofficial pushshift api, no substantial useable data could be collected at the moment. perhaps a TODO.
