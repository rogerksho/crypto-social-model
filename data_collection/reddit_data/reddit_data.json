I plan to purchase from Coinbase (seems like a good option for my first couple) and then transfer immediately from Coinbase to my Ledger. \n\nMy questions are, what is the purpose of using Coinkite MultiSig with a Ledger Nano and is it even necessary for my investment strategy? \n\nIs Coinkite MultiSig primarily for added security when sending bitcoins? \n\nIf I use Coinkite, will my bitcoins be stored on Coinkite or my Ledger?

I thought I would share something.\n\nDespite the die-hard Bitcoiners (anti-Litecoiners) you may read quotes from online, let me share with you some information that makes me ever more confident in Litecoin.\n\nI have been in cryptocurrency for a few years now, and through this time have introduced a number of friends to the concept.  The conversation always starts with Bitcoin, and then I explain altcoins as well.\n\nEvery friend who has become interested, and invested into Bitcoin has also invested into Litecoin.  Either they recognize the problems of Bitcoin right away, or they just can not see why there would be only one cryptocurrency if it is an open source technology.  \n\nI think people are very open to there being more than one Bitcoin.  And for some reason, they seem to be very open to Litecoin.  I think Charlie Lee has done a great job promoting Litecoin the way he has.\n\nBe it the name, or the logo, or the nice blue color, my friends and colleagues all seem to like Litecoin. \n\nI like it also.\n\nHappy New Year to all of you !\nAll of the best for 2016\n\n-------------------------------\n\nTLDR: Litecoin is awesome, and everyone new to cryptocurrency recognizes it.",

I sent him a quick message to disregard the requested refund that was automatically sent on my behalf by the DHL system. I used their 'Direct Pay' option, which negates the need to transfer money to the market. I used the address to send straight from my Grams account to his wallet, and had a litle extra since I put in more to cover fees. He replied but the pack hadalready landed by the time he did, and it didn't affect the transaction whatsoever.\n_Stealth:_               |[`9`] / 10 - This stealth was quite adequate, nothing over the top, and nothing too fancy or cheesy enough to actually draw attention. It was pretty straightforward, and the pack was also well sealed, well camoflauged, whatever you wanna call it, since there was no handwriting on the pack to begin with. I used to get non-DNM relatedshipments of flowers from a buddy out west and if I didn't know any better, I'd think MMM was him, as the packs he used to send were packaged very similarly. I'm sure with more weight the stealth changes, but for my needs, this was fine.\n_Shipping time:_     |[`10`] / 10 - Fantastic promptness right here, folks. I was worried at first, because I'd ordered on Saturday after Christmas I believe, I was fully aware the order wouldn't ship until Monday. Well, maybe it was early enough on Saturday, I don't know for sure, but the pack arrived Tuesday to the EC of the US. I mean I've seen some fast Priority, but I can't imagine it would have gotten here Tuesday if it was shipped Monday. Perhaps the USPS folks emptied boxes and sorted on Sunday, but either way, this shit got here quick.\n_Price value:_            |[`10`] / 10 - Received 8.0g+ of the Chernobyl, along with a 1.0g(+) sample of the Purple Chem Trail, which seemed to be MMM's flagship strain at the time of purchase. Maybe it was an FE bonus, maybe it was an Xmas gift, but it was definitely appreciated. Oh! I almost forgot! There is a review on DHL bitching about getting sent the wrong strain, but I don't see this being true, really. His listings everywhere for Chernobyl were scant and barely were more than 2g, so I figured he'd be out. He sent me the right buds, and, upon inspection, there were two anomalous buds in the quarter. I pulled them, happy to have yet one more of MMM's fine strains to enjoy. It was only about a half gram, which if half the bag was this stuff, I wouldn't bitch about it. I thought maybe it was the Bruce Banner, but one toke and I instantly knew it has to be his Banana Kush. It literally has a taste of bananas. Delish. Now for all of this, including shipping, I paid ~$73USD. 9+ grams of heady herb for less than $80? Yes, please.\n_Aesthetics:_           |[`10`] / 10 - Gorgeous flowers. Well cured, well trimmed, bags labeled with abbreviations to denote strains, package was professional and well sealed, all around perfect on aesthetics.\n_Weight:_              |[`10`] / 10 - Extra included, so this one's a given.\n_Quality:_              |[`10`] / 10 - Fire smoke, here folks. Every strain is phenomenal. The buds are a touch drier than I expected, but the humidity where I live will take care of that, if it lasts that long. I love this stuff. The smoke isn't harsh at all, and the flavors are all very well pronounced. The Chernobyl is definitely my favorite.\n_Transaction:_        |[`10`] / 10 - Flawless, smooth as silk, easy as 1-2-3.\n_Vendor:_               |[`10`] / 10 - Top notch vendor here folks, screw what redditors had to say about him in the midst of a Bitcoin Bull Run and two markets exit scamming in November and late October. There is no fucking way I'd have not done the same thing given the circumstances. You gotta look out for numero uno, because those same buyers would have done the exact same thing.\n_Drug:_                  |[`10`] / 10 - Herb is dee best, mang! The only thing I could say needed improvement is that my extra weight was a little light ;-D. Buy with confidence, folks, MMM has the goods, and is located such that two business days cover pretty much the entire country for him.\n|\n|\n|\n|_TOTAL SCORE:_ | __[`99`] / 100__\nFolks, see http://imgur.com/PJEsKkp for an image of the three strains I have here. On the left are the two pieces of what I believe to be Banana Kush, in the center is the Chernobyl, and on the right, the Purple Chem Trail. All are fan-fucking-tastic. Happy New Year everyone!!",

        "selftext": "We're seeing a number of news stories about legitimate financial institutions looking at finding uses for \"blockchain technology\".  Here's how I think it goes every time.\n\nBitcoin is in the news a lot, and from the outside one might think there was really something to it.  After all, a person can transmit money (sort of) across the planet for very low fees, which would appear to mean the network is super efficient.  So a bank or other financial institution looks at this and says, \"Let's see if we can adapt this technology for ourselves\".\n\nSo the vice president of the bank says, \"Johnson!  Look into this and figure out how we can make money off it\".\n\nJohnson looks into it thoroughly and realizes that there is absolutely nothing worth keeping in \"blockchain technology\".  It's grossly inefficient, which is masked by the fact that network is actually funded through monetary inflation rather than transaction fees.  If you throw out everything which makes it inefficient, like the proof of work and the distributed aspect of the network, you just have... a database.\n\nIt's like someone has built a car, and the body is made from styrofoam blocks.  As a result, it weighs 1/3 of a normal car, and cost half as much as a normal car to build, and gets double the mileage of a normal car with it's low weight.  It will also collapse entirely in any accident and kill anyone in the car, and will never be street legal.\n\nIf you investigate this car to see what about it might be worth keeping, with it's great gas mileage and cheap manufacturing cost, you will of course find that there is nothing whatsoever worth keeping.  It's interesting that it actually does function at all, but it's useless.\n\nSo Johnson goes back to the vice president and says, \"There's nothing worthwhile at all in blockchain technology, but we could just make some sort of online database which does X Y Z which we aren't doing as of yet, and call it blockchain technology, get lots of press and investors will never know the difference\".\n\nAnd the vice president says, \"Good work, Johnson!\"",

This includes people of all opinions. Thank you for helping r/btc and the bitcoin community as a whole.\n\nId like to announce the following:\n\n#In the interest of full transparency we are opening mod chat for public viewing.\n\nWe consider this a huge \"what if\" that I have never seen another subreddit do before (admittedly I dont visit many outside the bitcoin space). It could go really bad, really good or really mediocre. Just fair warning.\n\nDisclaimer:\nIf at any point it seems like opening up mod chat is too distracting from our intended goal (Creating a space for open bitcoin discussion), we may have to collectively get together and decide to take it back to private. I think at the end of the day we **do** want to be transparent but our larger goal honestly is to simply moderate a space that is as comfortable as it can possibly be.\n\nFor the time being I am making a request that the r/btc community refrain from making too many posts on what you see in mod chat. If the pages of r/btc end up totally comprised of what happens in mod chat, it will mean that our larger goal (to allow open bitcoin discussion &amp; news) is not being reached and again we may have to then discuss taking it private. The goal is to not be the news but to provide insight to just how human it can be.\n\nWhat you are going to see is going to be human... It wont be perfect and there are times you may see something that you arent happy with. Our request is that you afford us the benefit of the doubt that at the end of the day we will always attempt to make decisions to the absolute best of our ability.\n\nWithout further ado:\n\nr/btc_mod_chat",

        "selftext": "Hey X and Y\n\nAre you two aware that the Bitcoin Core devs are making big changes to\nthe bitcoin network which fundamentally change the economics of\nbitcoin and what you can and can't do with bitcoin?\n\nIf people continue to use the Bitcoin Core software many of the things\nthat we know work well in the bitcoin network, are going to be\ndiscarded and replaced with other things which may or may not work.\n\nIt's quite upsetting for me.  I've watched Bitcoin make it this far and\nnow it's like it's being torn apart in front of my eyes, largely by\nBlockstream and Viacoin employees/founders who develop Bitcoin Core.\nThese people have a serious conflict of interest and they are clearly\nacting on that conflict.\n\nAt this point the only core devs I trust are: Gavin Andresen, Jeff\nGarzik and Mike Hearn.  Of those 3, both Gavin and Hearn have been\nostracized out of Bitcoin Core development and I think Jeff will be\nsoon too as he clearly is pushing back against the agenda of the\nproblematic Bitcoin Core devs (eg Peter Todd, Luke JR and G Maxwell).\n\nOne example of the destructive things the Core devs are doing is this:\n\nPeter Todd is pushing for something called Full-RBF.  0-conf\ntransactions are an essential part of the Bitcoin ecosystem.  They are\nused widely by many businesses (eg ShapeShift.io).  There are risks\nassociated with accepting 0-conf transactions, but those risks can be\nmitigated and managed.  Full-RBF will vastly decrease the usefulness of\n0-conf transactions. Peter Todd is literally adding code to Bitcoin\nCore that damages Bitcoin.  If they achieve their goal of getting a\nsignificant number of miners using Bitcoin Core with Full-RBF mode\nenabled, it will no longer be practical to use Bitcoin in stores to pay\nfor goods as you will be forced to wait for 1 confirmation.  People\nwill be forced into off-chain solutions (eg Coinbase.com offchain\ntransactions).  It will no longer be safe for the shop keeper to accept\nbitcoin transactions from SPV wallets (eg Breadwallet).\n\nWith Full RBF, 0-conf transactions will become something you can only\nrely on for:\n* trading with trustworthy people (eg friends, family and businesses\nyou have an established relationship with)\n* signalling that your transaction has entered the network (not that it\nwill likely confirm).\n\nTodd has already successfully committed code to Bitcoin Core's master\nbranch that performs something called Opt-in Full-RBF.  This Opt-in\nFull-RBF isn't as bad as Full RBF, but it has a whole bunch of really\nnegative repercussions.  The main ones being:\n* it makes Bitcoin more complicated for novice users to understand\n* it increases the complexity of wallets\n* it makes it more likely that novice users will be scammed\n\nAlso: the term \"opt-in\" is very (and probably deliberately)\nmisleading.  The sender of the transaction opts-in to creating a\ntransaction, but the receiver does not opt-in.  Wallet devs will also be\nforced to make changes to deal with this new transaction type if\nBitcoin Core continues to be used.  They will be forced to add weird\nmessages to their wallet software which say something like:\n\"You have received an RBF transaction.  Unlike normal transactions, RBF\ntransactions can be more easily double spent.  If you are unsure what\nthis means, you should wait for at least 1 confirmation.\"\n\nIn-fact.  That lengthy message doesn't even give the user all the\ninfo they need to know.  It doesn't explain *why* they might have\nreceived the RBF transaction:\n* are they under attack?\n* is the sender trying to bump their transaction fee?\n* is the senders wallet software misconfigured?\n\nIt adds a layer of complexity which is completely unnecessary.\n\nAnother thing they are doing is unnecessarily keeping the maximum block\nsize capped at 1MiB.  1MiB was always widely understood to be a\ntemporary limit to stop the blockchain getting too bloated in the early\ndays of the currency.  It kept the network cheap to run and easy to\njoin.  Keeping it stuck this low now that we are hitting that limit\nregularly is going to cause what Jeff Garzik refers to as an \"Economic\nChange Event\" (ECE).  You can read about it here:\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011973.html\n\nThis ECE is going to materialize as absolute havoc on the\nnetwork; probably within the next 6 months. There will be many\nfrustrated users on account of stuck/delayed transactions.  It will\nbecome far more expensive to send transactions. Many people will sell\ntheir Bitcoin holdings causing the price to drop.  Many people will\nsimply not understand what is happening and out of fear and uncertainty\nthey will sell off their holdings.  Businesses that relied on cheap\ntransactions will close up shop.  Mainstream media will [correctly]\nportray Bitcoin as a failed attempt at creating a global currency.  The\ngrowth of Bitcoin will be stumped.\n\nI've heard probably every single reasoned argument related to the\nblocksize debate and it is abundantly obvious to me that it's perfectly\nsafe to increase the maximum blocksize.\n\nAnyway.  I wanted to let you guys know what I think about what's going\non.  I'd be interested to know if you share any of my concerns or if\nthis is the first you're hearing about these issues.\n\nIf you agree with me I strongly urge you to avoid using the Bitcoin\nCore software and advise others not to use it either.  There are 3\ndecent full-node alternatives to choose from and soon there will soon\nbe a forth:\nbtcd:              https://opensource.conformal.com/wiki/btcd\nBitcoin Unlimited: http://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/\nBitcoin XT:        https://bitcoinxt.software/\nToshi:             https://toshi.io/  [Warning: BETA software]\n\nAlso, you should avoid the following heavily censored websites:\nbitcoin.org\nreddit.com/r/bitcoin\nbitcointalk.org\n\nThere are decent replacements for those sites/pages where you can\nfreely discuss these issues without being banned/muted:\nhttps://www.bitcoin.com\nhttps://forum.bitcoin.com/\nhttps://reddit.com/r/btc\nhttps://bitco.in/forum/\nhttps://letstalkbitcoin.com/forum/\n\nHope you are both well,\nZ\n",

        "selftext": "These are some issues and practicalities around bitcoin that confuse me, so I'm hoping that more experienced Bitcoin users can shed some light on them.\n\nFirstly, For the real Bitcoin believers, do you spend the bitcoins you already have regularly? The reason I ask is because it seems to me that the believers must expect the price to rise substantially over the coming years, so wouldn't it be wiser to hang on to every single bitcoin they have? For example, if I owned some shares and was expecting them to rise in price, I likely wouldn't sell them right now.\n\nSecondly, when a person decides to get bitcoin for the first time they usually would need to buy it with fiat currency. But that means that a current holder has to sell to them. If supply and demand balances out, doesn't that mean that there are lots of sellers that aren't expecting the price to rise much in the near future. I realize that people will also be selling for other reasons, but there must be some that prefer fiat currency, else they wouldn't sell.\n\nThirdly, if all goes well with bitcoin and the price continues to rise steadily, that's causing deflation. So won't that mean people holding off on making large purchases because they know they can get the same product for less next year. e.g. if you want t buy something that costs 2 BTC now, and you expect BTC to double in value against USD, then you are better waiting until that happens and buy for 1 BTC.

They will review your ad, and they will tell you which words need to change to get a protected ad. **I had to go through 13 rounds of changes to my advertisement** before the Reddit Advertising Team gave me written confirmation that my advertisement would be fully protected against any moderator complaints.",

        "selftext": "Stop. Before you downvote, let me explain.  \n\nNo, I have **not** been hired by Blockstream (I turned down their offer ;)\n\nThe reason I support Maxwell\u2019s Scaling Roadmap is because it adds finality to this debate: \n\n**There will be no increase to the max block size limit by Core in 2016.** \n\nIf you share my view, then this is unreasonable.  The block size limit needs to rise, and it needs to rise soon.  Since Core has made it clear that they will not do this, the only option is to deprecate Core in favour of competing implementations. \n\nAs part of my New Year\u2019s resolution, I will stop trying to convince Core developers to change their minds.  They have made their decision and I will respect that.  Instead, I will work with other like-minded individuals to return Bitcoin back to Satoshi\u2019s original vision for a system that could scale up to a worldwide payment network and a decentralized monetary system. I will also welcome existing developers from Core to join me in these efforts.  \n\nThe guiding principle for this new implementation is that the evolution of the network is decided by the code people *freely* choose to run. Consensus is therefore an emergent property, objectively represented by the longest proof-of-work chain. \n\nThe final sentence of the Bitcoin white paper states:\n\n*\u201cThey [nodes/miners] vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.\u201d*\n\nIt is this mechanism of \"voting with their CPU power\" that keeps Bitcoin permissionless and uncensorable. Were it possible to compel miners to run a specific application with a specific set of rules then it would be trivial for the owner of the codebase to, for example, invalidate transactions, modify the inflation schedule, block certain bitcoin addresses or IP ranges, limit the quantity of transactions in a block, or implement any other centralized policies.\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin only maintains its intrinsically valuable properties of being permissionless, uncensorable, trustless, and uninflatable, precisely because the software is not, and should not be, controlled by any single governance entity.\n\nSo please join me in an effort to move away from the single governance entity that presently controls and handicaps Bitcoin: Core. \n\nLet me conclude by saying that what is unfolding is the *best* possible scenario: we will get a significant block size limit increase in 2016 *and* we will decentralize development.  \n\nHappy New Years everyone!

I omitted my parts, but you can get the gist of it.\n\n\n\n______________________________________________\n\nM is the brother. Plot thickens. original post edited, M being brother verified \n\n(Yes, I tried to edit it, but this euphoric investigator had the incredible power of clicking \u201cback\u201d on his browser)\n\ni've got a few days off from my JOB. was bored enough to browse your posts where you admitted you have none and sponge off your gf. good \"job\" if you can get it? \n\nbetter to sit around being a leech, i guess? \n\n(he doxxed that I have a medical disability that required brain surgery and left me legally deaf and with only half of normal balance. He's a Randian superbeing, so he looks down on my poor choice of genes)\n\ni've got a few days off from my JOB. was bored enough to browse your posts where you admitted you have none and sponge off your gf. good \"job\" if you can get it? \n\noh, i have no real purpose on this post. just getting laughs that you're so kylo-emo over bro-bro M. you have no job, no life. and post about how neckbeardy he is. \n\nas i said, i have a few days off from the job. reddit reading, even your self-serving brother-hating posts are amusing when i have a few minutes off during the workday. you don't seem to have any issue talking shit about so many people in neckbeard stories. so i have no problem at all talking shit about you. sorry if the double standard is an issue. to be honest, i'm glad i finally realized M is your brother. makes you keeping in touch with his wife and tolerating him as long as you did understandable. you do write pretty well, even if your jealousy of M does shine through pretty badly. if you put as much time into writing stuff for $ as you did for getting out your brotherly jealousy, maybe you could make a good living. \n\nAnd your bitter misery while pointing out others' bitter misery makes you so noble. I tip my fedora to you, good sir. \n\n(BONUS CONTENT!)\n\n(This isn't from the same account name, but judge for yourself if this is an alt or just the loyal defender's mustered reinforcements)\n\nI was going to mock you but after reading through your submitted history it's just depressing. I'm sorry that your life is shit and that you make fun of others to feel better.\n\nHow about you actually read the reasons why I think you're full of shit. Probably won't because you're either here to just be an absolute cunt or you're literally too stupid to be able to respond and answer why you think it is possible to take down the Bitcoin network.\n\nI assume you believe that there is a handful of servers and that if you take that out you kill Bitcoin? Because if you do, you're dumber than a fucking invalid child.\n\nDo you even know what the term libertarian means? How on earth you would apply that term to anything I just said is absolutely beyond me and I majored in Political Science. Besides, I'm very far from libertarian, I'm all about socialism, universal healthcare, free education et al. Hell, I'd advocate a universal basic income.\n\nI'm sorry that your life is absolutely shit (I read your sob story in /r/LateStageCapitalism) but you're a fucking idiot/asshole.\n\nL2DEBATE\n\nps /r/Neckbeardthings is you; which is why you have so many stories of such things; because you're online all the time and have gone batshit.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nToday we continue our coverage of the glorious Bitcoin Foundation by assisting them with their own transparency [goals](http://bitcoinfoundation.org/transparency/). Just like any tax-exempt non-profit the Foundation has to file Form 990 annually, and so they did on 2015-07-23. The website with transparency goals actually previously stated [\"2014 will become available once filed in the spring of 2015\"](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1095310.0). Par for the course Bruce 'FENTON!' Fenton figured he may as well hide it after realizing the return may reflect poorly on the Foundation. Luckily our shills over at the [Foundation Center](http://foundationcenter.org/findfunders/990finder/) are kind enough to provide us with a copy. \n\nBear in mind this is the fiscal year dated 01-01-2014 ending 12-31-2014, the year Bitcoin took a massive hit. For context; the Bitcoin Foundation has one primary asset: BTC-coins. At the beginning of the year BTC-coins were still worth quite a bit (some $800), while shortly into the year they traded slightly closer to fair-value (ending the year at $316). Perhaps you would expect the Foundation to curb expenses, however that goes against the libertarian school of thought (fuck you, got mine!). \n\nNow on to the good stuff, here's how our favorite group of libertarians spent the majority of donated funbux in one year, knowing the Foundation's assets were depleting rapidly. As Reddit is known for bullshit doxxing rules we'll stick to what is written on the return, which is very much open to public inspection. Now, without further ado;\n\nAs we discovered in 2013 the Foundation's primary goal is rewarding their board of directors &amp; officers, as we all know they work very hard:\n\n* Gavin Andresen: $147k. Head scientist. Salary down from $209k (salary was higher in 2013 as it was pegged to BTCUSD)\n* Jodie Brady: $141k. COO of the Foundation, while also serving as CFO at CoinLab (Peter Vessenes' chop shop). Two full time jobs?\n* Jon Matonis: Still hiding his pay nicely under VII Section A, regardless he did pull $137.5k through \"THE HOLE OF ROY LLC\". Salary up from $31k. Jon acted as CEO up to October 2014.\n* Patrick Murck: $115k. CEO of the Foundation (as of November 2014). Salary up from $57k. \n\nAnd there are some contractors:\n\n* \"LOCAL PRODUCER\" was paid $790k to host Bitcoin 2014 in Amsterdam. This for-profit 'company' is owned by a person who at the time had a board seat at the Dutch \"Bitcoin Stichting\" (non-profit advocate group). \n* Apple Fundraising Consultants were also paid $123k for activities related to the aforementioned conference.\n* THEPOLICYCOUNCILCOM INC is in fact the Foundation's 'Global Policy Counsel', paid $114k for about 9 months of work in 2014. In a press release from the Foundation on the 15th of December you'll read that (Global Policy Counsel) has bailed, Bobby Lee adds \"(Global Policy Counsel) and Olivier served as **volunteers** and we appreciate their time and work\". Odd way of volunteering.\n\nAnd the breakdown of the functional expenses, oh, so many expenses:\n\n* Office Expenses: $39k up from $8k in 2013.\n* Information Technology: $158k up from $67k (?!). \n* Travel: $159k up from $69k (?!). \n* Occupancy: $18k up from $7k.\n* Accounting: $50.5k up from $9.1k. Really, for preparing a 990?\n* Legal fees: $220k up from $161k.\n* Other: $653k, consisting of: \n\t- Professional services: $307k\n\t- Public relations: $93k\n\t- Executive Directory Compensation: $137.5k (this probably is Matonis as mentioned above)\n\t- Professional event expenses: $115k\n* Other salaries and wages: $471k up from $72k (this includes coders, assistants, Mark Karpeles' cat, etc.)\n\nThe revenues improved a lot of course, as you would expect with the increased expenses:\n\n* Membership dues: $335k down from $358k\n* Conference revenue: $584k up from $337k\n \nAt the end of 2014 not much was left: $366k. Of course some membership fees were coming in early 2015 which allowed the board to continue their rampage a little longer. In the board meeting minutes of 7-21 you can read that the party is over ($59k left) and expenses have been cut to $14k/month. Meeting minutes of October show \"Brock says that it looks like things were going well from a revenue standpoint until February and we've lost the remaining cash since then\" (LOL). Desperation strikes near the end of the meeting with Bruce 'FENTON!' Fenton asking all participants to [individually raise $10k](http://bitcoinfoundation.org/bitcoin-foundation-board-meeting-minutes-10-20-15/) before the next board meeting. Olivier Janssens doubts this is possible, and also states he isn't happy that financials haven't been published yet. Well now they are. \n\nIn fairness to the Foundation there have been some roster changes and most (if not all) people mentioned above are no longer involved. Which may or may not have something to do with that fact they could no longer get paid by the Foundation (kidding, of course it has everything to do with that). \n\ntl;dr Libertarians are bad at managing finances.",

It was not detailed to how long they would be gone, and there was no permenant post anywhere else saying this. Me and the other moderators were not told how long they would be gone for and we have no other way of communicating with them other than the market, and now that it is down we really can not to anything to see what is going on.\n\n&gt;As far as myself is aware there were no problems with withdrawls, but I could be wrong. There were some buyers posting about issues with deposits.\n\n&gt;/u/Satoshi- is one of them and has posted a thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3yuuyi \n&gt;/east_india_company_adminssupport_awol_for_over_a/ that has not been fixed.\n\n&gt;/u/DunGoofedonEIC is another one of them and posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3yjd11/eic_timed_out_and_my_coins_are_gone_help/.\n\n&gt;/u/abrakazan is another one of them and posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3y47es/eic_ordering_issue/.\n\n&gt;/u/c9twy had an issue that was resolved 11 days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3xbirk/problem_with_eic_multisig_refund/\n\n&gt;/u/Pelican_Vendor is the only vendor that I know that is on reddit so he might be able to say if he could withdrawl Bitcoin before the market went down.\n\n&gt;I wish I could give answers but sadly this is the best I can do.\n\n",

However, it comes with a serious branding problem.\n\nWhenever specific numbers are brought into the debate -- whether it's 2-4-8, or XT's increases, or any \"compromise\", -- everyone misses the point. Forever. The discussion inevitably devolves into statements like \"reasonable increases\", \"too extreme\", \"too slow\", \"compromise\", in an attempt to find the \"best\" increase. These discussions are not productive.\n\nWhile we're discussing those numbers, the most important points get lost:\n\n1. We don't want Core (or anyone else) deciding this for us.\n2. The blocksize limit is not the blocksize.\n\nI realize that these are easy things to understand, and most people reading this do understand. So then, why do we keep tripping over the numbers?\n\nIt's human nature.\n\nWe trip over the numbers because numbers give people something solid to grab onto and debate. It's a form of Bike Shedding. But it's hurting us badly, and contributing to some of the toxicity in the community.\n\nWe, as a community, would be more successful if we stopped talking about specific increases. Bitcoin Unlimited seems to be heading in this direction.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi, I'm developer and I really care about bitcoin and I want to do something to help, so I made this simple script to start your own bitcoinxt/bitcoinunlimited node. I tried to make it as simple as possible for anyone who has 5 minutes, regardless of your technical ability. It costs $25 a month (first two months free) to vote with your code, so please help out if you care enough to complain. So here's instructions for how to setup a google cloud instance of bitcoinxt/unlimited. Please keep in mind there are cheaper options out there, but they don't usually give you 2 months free.\n\n**Get a google cloud account**\n\n* Go to https://cloud.google.com/\n* Click on the \"Try it free\" button\n* Sign into google\n* Fill out your personal info\n* Click on the 3 horizontal bars in the top left of the page, it should pull out a drawer. Go down to \"Compute Engine\" and click on it.\n\n***Create your instance! (Exact flow might be slightly different, use your head and look around!)***\n\n* Click on \"VM Instances\" on the left\n* Click the button \"New instance\" top center of the page\n* Name: Name your instance something like \"bitcoinxt-01\"\n* Zone: Select your computing resource region/zone\n* Machine type: Leave the Machine type as 1 vCPU 3.75 GB of memory\n* Boot disk: * Click \u201cChange\u201d * Pick Ubuntu 15.10 (Any ubuntu will do for this script) * Leave Boot disk type as \"Standard persistent disk\" * Set Boot disk size to 100GB * Click \u201cSelect\u201d\n* Create Instance by clicking Blue \u201cCreate\u201d button\n* Wait for the spinning wheel to turn into a green check\n* Scroll down to bottom, find the name of the instance you just created (under \u201cName\u201d column) and click the link (to edit)\n\n***Setup the firewall!***\n\n* Click on the green check, scroll down to where it says\nNetwork default\n* Click on \"default\"\n* Click \"Add firewall rule\"\n* Set \"bitcoin\" or whatever as the name\n* Set \"Source filter\" to \"Allow from any source (0.0.0.0/0)\"\n* Set \"Allowed protocols and ports\" to \"tcp:8333\" and click \"Create\"\n\n***Install bitcoinxt/unlimited!***\n\n* Click the SSH button at the top left above the green check (might be to the right of the check), this should open a new tab with a command line in it. You can type stuff here.\n* Copy this command into the command line\nwget -O- https://gist.githubusercontent.com/snakecharmer1024/97bcc84f6336ee50e63d/raw/9d15cb62c4e53ba27f5f7e00c71404f437d2cf64/bitcoinxt-installer.sh | sudo bash\nor if you want BitcoinUnlimited, another excellent choice\nwget -O- https://gist.githubusercontent.com/snakecharmer1024/922e31196c98675b54b5/raw/02b5e8d2e7296fbb41c3fc28e5b39f192d9cb2c6/bitcoin-unlimited-installer.sh | sudo bash\nand hit \"Enter\"\n*After it returns the command prompt, you've installed bitcoinxt!\n\n***Check that your node is up***\n\n* Close your ssh tab\n* Back on your google cloud tab, click the back button above the ssh button\n* To the right of the green check, you should see an ip address (something like 130.211.161.234). Copy it\n* Go to https://bitnodes.21.co/#join-the-network\n* Near the bottom of the page, it says, \"Join the network\", copy your ip address into the first text box, type 8333 into the second text box and click \"Check Node\"\n* If it's green, you're up! Otherwise something went wrong...\n\n\nOk thanks for reading, please ask for help if you can't get it to work.\n\nBtw, if you want to prune the blockchain, you can change the \n\nbitcoind &amp; \n\ncommand to this\n\nbitcoind -prune 4096 &amp;\n\nto only keep 4GB of blockchain. \n\nPlease also watch the [excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGZuATPdVo0) by /u/nicolasgramlich",

I want to extend that idea to everyone playing this massively multiplayer game.\n\nTo avoid people destroying what others create, the acyc datastruct (immutable binary forest nodes where all data is in their shape, no data in the nodes themselves) can build on what others create without modifying it. All creation of new data is in the combining of existing data, which you can start with 1s and 0s or use existing structures of them like words, pictures, and game physics.\n\nOne of the challenges in this game is its not a complete game. It will be just a bunch of crazy looking stuff and tools laying around a shared space on the Internet. What the players create together is up to them. That includes expanding it into new network shapes, building new game objects and behaviors, and teaching the simulated brains new things or building new kinds of simulated brains.\n\nAs a general computing system, the players will be able to do anything they want as long as enough others go along with it sharing their computing power.\n\nIt will be up to the players if the game succeeds or if it falls apart when not enough people or their computers agree on what paths data should flow through the network. The network itself is happy to leave important content on a computer that nobody ever looks in, unless they program or teach the AIs to do something else.\n\nThis is the unique challenge of this new kind of computing network and game and AI research space. Its not scripted. You either build a democracy, or some other useful system of organizing things, or the system will fall apart. Keeping it real.\n\nOf course you can always start a new network with the same code, but imagine doing that with Bitcoin after the first network became a multi-billion dollar economy. There are real things to create and lose in the networks we can build together, even if its not based on a money paradigm. Its more of a \"lets build some crazy stuff together\" paradigm.\n\nDetails and some early prototypes of incomplete parts at http://humanai.net",

Although similar, Google Wallet is the dominant choice as it is easy to use and it's biggest difference between paypal is that it's **FREE** to use in every way possible. There are no fees to be had with using the service with either party. The only downfall to this service is that it is **NOT AVAILABLE TO BE USED OUTSIDE YOUR RESIDING COUNTRY.** Accepting Google Wallet For US customers only. Thank you\n\n\n## **FORMS OF PAYMENT**\n\n* GOOGLE WALLET (Preferred Payment)\n* VENMO\n* SKRILL\n* PAYPAL\n* BITCOIN\n* SQUARE CASH\n* AMAZON E-GIFT CARD\n\nClick [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=GMachina \"BUY SOME STUFF!\") to pay for key!
